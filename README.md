# html-css-js-framework

## limitations

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites in general have serious limitations in terms of user features and developer experience
  - this site is meant to be an academic exercise in order to learn the limits of HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites
- if you want more functionality
  - e.g. if you want to have a backend CRUD API, to use TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, axios, etc.
- and especially if you are studying to work as a web developer
	- then spend your time instead learning **JavaScript frameworks**:
		- [React](https://react.dev) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
		- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) / [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)
		- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) / [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
		- [Angular](https://angular.io)
		- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
		- [Remix](https://remix.run)
		- [Astro](https://astro.build)
		- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io)
