# html-css-js-framework

## limitations

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites in general have serious limitations in terms of user features and developer experience
  - this site is meant to be an academic exercise in order to learn the limits of HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites
- if you want more functionality
  - e.g. if you want to have a backend CRUD API, to use TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, axios, etc.
- and especially if you are studying to work as a web developer
	- then spend your time instead learning **JavaScript frameworks**:
		- [React](https://react.dev) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
		- Vue / Nuxt
		- Angular
		- Svelte
		- Solid
		- Remix
		- Astro
